## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed --> 
<!-- The following are just sample -->
I created a single page website displaying some of artworks and explaining my style in detail. I firstly introduced myself as an artist and highlighted my main works. Telling how I go about my works and passions. Sections were used to create seperation of contents and give it a clean and organized look, along side using buttons.

Guiding Question:

- Whats the purpose - to create a single page website.
- What are key components - introduction of myself and display of artworks.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
